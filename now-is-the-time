Watched repeat Star Trek episodes of the original, TNG, and Voyager on BBC America.

Suddenly wondered why I never hear much about DS9, nor do I see repeats on other networks.

I remembered how I really liked it. 

In my mind it was The Expanse of the 1990s.

Synopsis of DS9 plot

DS9 strengths:
  * fully developed, nuanced characters.
  * strong female leaders- Kira, Dax, Cassidy, Quark' mother, Kai Winn, and Leta.
  * concepts of religion, spirituality, metaphysics, and philosophy.
  * dynamics of race, gender, and culture. 
  * politics and socieoeconomic issues.
  * relationships (romantic, friendship, interspecies, and so on)
  
DS9 appeal now:
  * antithesis of current global climate
  * exploration, diplomacy, science, culture, art
  * the ideal of inclusion--bring other species under a common federation
  * Sisko - Obama - 45 
  * strong portrayal of women 
  * upcoming docummentary of DS9 anniversay
 
 NSF committment
  * review episodes I like
  * reflect on social allegories from DS9 and apply to present day
  * gifs and memes whenever possible
